# Student-dataset
# In this project the data is available for the students scores along with various factors that affect the student score like...
# the student scores depend on parent eduction status , parent marital status , study hour , reading time , writing time ..
# In this code , the un- named and empty data has been dropped and removed from the data set . 
# I have compaired the student score with all the various data and then visualized them to plot the data to have a better understanding of the datasets available.
